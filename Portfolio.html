As a student, I'm dedicated to not only acquiring knowledge but also applying it in practical settings. Through coursework, projects, and collaborative initiatives, I've had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in areas such as Problem Solving and Logical Thinking.

While my journey is still in its early stages, I approach each opportunity with enthusiasm, curiosity, and a commitment to continual learning and growth. I firmly believe that education is not only about acquiring information but also about cultivating the skills and mindset necessary to thrive in the ever-evolving field of IT.
